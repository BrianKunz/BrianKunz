<h1>Hello! I'm Brian Kunz</h1>

I am a Software Engineer with experience working in teams across various industries and fields. I have adapted to be able to collaborate with a wide variety of people and learned to connect teams with different objectives to unify and completed a project. Growing up just south of Boston exposed me to technology at an early age. My love of technology started early on and makes me excited to think about how I can change the world with it!

Graduate of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Flex program.
